This repistory is for my high school graduation project, which is the EVE APP, which is an android app made for blind and visually impaired people.
The app has 2 main functions:
1. Color Detector- which helps recognise which color the user sees on its camera.
2. Chat app.
The app is a server-client app, server and client both wrriten in C#, multithreaded server.
The client side's GUI was made using XAMARIN platform on Visual Studio.
